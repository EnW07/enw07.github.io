# About Me

I am a first-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at ADA University in Baku.

I am interested in:
- Programming and building small projects
- Learning web development and AI tools
- Working on practical projects that I can later use for freelance or internships

This website is part of my SITE1101 course and will grow as I complete more projects.
